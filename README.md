💫 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on web automation systems, scalable data scraping pipelines, and custom Python bots that streamline repetitive online tasks.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source automation tools, scraping frameworks, and productivity-driven Python projects.

🤝 I’m looking for help with distributed scraping architectures, cloud deployment (CI/CD), and performance optimization for large-scale automation systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced asynchronous Python, cloud orchestration, Docker-based deployments, and scalable scraping infrastructure.

💬 Ask me about Python, Selenium, Playwright, Scrapy, browser automation, structured data extraction, and workflow automation.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy turning complex manual workflows into one-click automated systems — if it’s repetitive, I’ll automate it.

If you'd like, I can also create:

🔥 A more bold/attention-grabbing version

💼 A client-focused version (to attract Upwork clients)

🧠 A more developer-community/open-source focused version

✨ A highly aesthetic GitHub-style version with layout formattin
